# openTiS

How to install:

1. Grab the oTiS HUD from Tonaie Resident in SL.
2. Create a firestorm preprocessor include folder.
3. Install XOBJ (https://github.com/JasXSL/SL-XOBJ)
4. Create a folder in the preprocessor includes directory and name it ots
5. Put this project files there

For now most of the code is stored in SL only, but the code should be open source. Except for st COM


# to do
* Spawner system (SpawnHUB? How to get party members? How to drop monsters? Cubes? Notecards? Debug)
* Mission transponder (How to manage entire level from one game?)
* Mission status progress on HUD (How to make it non-obtrusive?)
* Monster scene scripts (json? notecards? how to inject?)
* NPC interaction system (NPC portraits? Dialog options?)
* Try (and fail) at making a humanoid (I was thinking a minotaur?)
* Automatic difficulty adjuster (Killing monster makes it harder, getting knocked down makes it easier, make it per player or per party?)
* Design Website (Bweee color choices!)
* Allow guns to be purchased
* Augments (Sets? Minor/Major augs?)
* Weapon attachments?
